# Highlight.vim

Highlight vim plugin to set a background color to span of texts.

Sometime you need to highlight words, sentences or any character spans in your text file, 
with a nice background color thepoint out keywords, labels, etc. 

I personally have this need 
- when analysing any text, with the aim to select verbs, nouns, speacial keywords, 
  having a nice visual overview of different kind of info 
- when annotating intents and entities in "conversational AI" / chatbot tools,
  like beloved [RASA](www.rasa.com)
- when programming in a standard programming language (nodeJs, Python) to put in evidence functions, variables, etc.

BTW, The original (open) points rised from my vi stackexchange questions:

- [Vim editor entities tagging/annotation tool](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/34821/vim-editor-entities-tagging-annotation-tool) 
- [How to replace selected text T with some function(T), using a keyboard shortcut?](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/34823/how-to-replace-selected-text-t-with-some-functiont-using-a-keyboard-shortcut/34824#34824) 


## Installation
