# Highlight.vim

Highlight is a vim plugin to highlight span of texts, using a background color, random picked or specified by user.
A set of user commands (in command mode) are supplied to select text in a bunch of different ways, 
from direct set, visual selection, etc.

## What?

Sometime you need to highlight words, sentences or any character spans in your text files, 
with a nice background color, with the goal of point out keywords, labels, tags, important sections, etc.

I personally have this need: 

- When analyzing a text, with the aim to select linguistics entities 
  (verbs, nouns, special keywords), with the help of a nice visual overview of different kind of contents

- When annotating intents and entities in "conversational AI" / chatbot tools, 
  like [RASA](www.rasa.com) and many others

- When programming in a standard programming language (NodeJs, Python) 
  just to put in evidence function names, variables, etc.

## Why really?

This project is related to the original (open) points raised from my vi stackexchange questions:

- [Vim editor entities tagging/annotation tool](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/34821/vim-editor-entities-tagging-annotation-tool) 
- [How to replace selected text T with some function(T), using a keyboard shortcut?](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/34823/how-to-replace-selected-text-t-with-some-functiont-using-a-keyboard-shortcut/34824#34824) 

The final goal is to create a plugin to annotate "conversational AI"/NLP attributes (intents, entities, etc.) within the vim editor! 
Stay tuned.


## Install

Using vim-plug, in your `.vimrc` file:

    Plug 'solyarisoftware/Highlight.vim'


## üöÄ Usage

In vim command mode you these commands are available:

- `HighlightColors` visualize all available colors
- `HighlightText text [color]` highlight a text/regexp with a random or specified color
- `HighlightVisual [color]` highlight a visual selection  with a random or specified color
- `HighlightWord [color]` highlight the word under the cursor with a random or specified color
- `HighlightLine [color]` highlight the current line with a random or specified color
- `HighlightUndo` undo last highlight command

‚öôÔ∏è the plugin uses `matchadd` vimscript function. 
This means that if you highlight a text span instance (say the keyword `temperature_body`), 
in facts all occurrences of the same text are highlighted with the same color. 
This is desired and smart, maybe in pretty all cases, but note that Highlight.vim commands act in that way.  


### `:HighlightColors` 

Show the list of available colors, highlighting each color name:

    :HighlightColors

A color name is one of the items: 
`color17`, `color18`, ..., `color254`, `color255`

> üí°Tip: in all commands below you can just pass the color also as a number, 
> by example: `color18` could be referred also as `18`

### `:HighlightText text [color]` 

- Highlight a word or sentence,  or a regexp pattern, picking a random background color:

        :HighlightText text

  The `text` is highlighted with a random chose background color.

  > üí°Tip: If you don't like the random background color, 
  > in command line just redo the Highlight command!

  > üí°Tip: the text pattern could be also a vimscript regexp pattern, 
  > by example: `HighlightText \ .HighlightText\ ` 
  > matches strings ` 1HighlightText ` or  ` 2HighlightText `, etc. 

- Highlight a word or sentence (the `text`), or a regexp pattern, with a specified background `color`

        :HighlightText text color

  The `text` is highlighted with the specified `color` (color name or corresponding color id). 

  > üí°Tip: if the text contains spaces, you need to escape them (` ` must be written `\ `), 
  > by example `some\ text\ to\ be\ colorized`

  Examples:
  - `HighlightText a text span made by many words`
  - `HighlightText /\vmin|max`
  - `HighlightText some_text_without_blanks color70`
  - `HighlightText some_text_without_blanks 70`
  - `HighlightText text\ containing\ blanks color69`
  - `HighlightText text\ containing\ blanks 69`

### `:HighlightVisual [color]` 

Highlight a visual selection

- picking a random background color:

        :HighlightVisual 

- selecting a specific background color:

        :HighlightVisual color

  > üí°Tip:  you can just pass the `color` as a number, `HighlightVisualWithColor 123`

  Examples:
  - `HighlightVisual`
  - `HighlightVisual 71`
  - `HighlightVisual color71`


### `:HighlightWord [color]` 

Highlight the word under the cursor

- picking a random background color:

        :HighlightWord 


### `HighlightLine [color]` 

Highlight the current line

- picking a random background color:

        :HighlightLine 


### `HighlightUndo` 

Undo the last Highlight command, 

        :HighlightUndo 


## Todo

- Make highlights from vim registers (yanked texts), e.g. with command `HighlightYanked`
- Assign custom labels to color names. 
  In that way you could afterward use the custom label instead of a color name or number.
- Make highlights persistent, tracking on file all changes on some readable format (e.g. JSON).
