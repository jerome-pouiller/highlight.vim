# Highlight.vim

Highlight vim plugin to set a background color to span of texts.

Sometime you need to highlight words, sentences or any character spans in your text file, 
witha nice background color thepoint out keywords, labels, etc. 

I personally have this need 
- when analysing any text, with the aim to select verbs, nouns, speacial keywords, 
  having a nice visual overview of different kind of info 
- when annotating intents and entities in "conversational AI" / chatbot tools,
  like beloved [RASA](www.rasa.com)
- when programming in a standard programming language (nodeJs, Python) to put in evidence functions, variables, etc.


## Installation

Using vim-plug, in your .vimrc file:
```
Plug 'solyarisoftware/Highlight.vim'
```


## Usage

In command mode

```
:Highlight some text to be colorized  
```

the text `some text to be colorized` is highlighted with a random chose background color.

> üí°Tip
>
> If yoo don't like the random background color, 
> in command line just redo the Highlight command!
