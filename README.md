# Highlight.vim

Highlight is a vim plugin to highlight span of textsi with a nbackground color.

Sometime you need to highlight words, sentences or any character spans in your text file, 
with a nice background color to point out keywords, labels, etc.

I personally have this need: 
- When analyzing a text, with the aim to select linguistics entities 
  (verbs, nouns, special keywords), 
  having a nice visual overview of different kind of info 
- When annotating intents and entities in "conversational AI" / chatbot tools, 
  like [RASA](www.rasa.com)
- When programming in a standard programming language (NodeJs, Python) 
  just to put in evidence function names, variables, etc.


## Install

Using vim-plug, in your .vimrc file:
```
Plug 'solyarisoftware/Highlight.vim'
```


## Usage

In vim command mode you have these commands:

### `Highlight` / `HighlightRandom` 
Highlight a word or sentence, picking a random background color:
```
:Highlight some text to be colorized  
```
or
```
:HighlightRandom some text to be colorized  
```

The text `some text to be colorized` is highlighted with a random chose background color.

> üí°Tip: If you don't like the random background color, 
> in command line just redo the Highlight command!

### `HighlightColor` 
Highlight a word or sentence, with a specified background color
```
:HighlightColor some\ text\ to\ be\ colorized color69  
```
the text `some text to be colorized` is highlighted with the specified color name 
(in the above example `color69`).

> Notes:
> - if the text contains spaces, you need to escape them (` ` must be written `\ `), 
> - colors names are in the list: 
>   `color17`, `color18`, `color19`, `color20`, ..., `color254`, `color255`

### `HighlightShowColors` 
Show the list of available color names, highlighting each colorname:
```
:HighlightShowColors  
```
